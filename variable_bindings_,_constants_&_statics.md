# Variable bindings , Constants & Statics

ðŸŒŸ In Rust variable are **immutable by default**, so we call them **Variable bindings**. To make them mutable, ```mut``` keyword is used.

ðŸŒŸ Rust is a **statically typed** language; It checks data type at compile time. But it **doesnâ€™t require you to actually type it when declare variable bindings**. On that case compiler checks the usage and set a better data type for it. But for **constants and statics you must annotate the type**. Types come after a colon(:)

* Variable bindings

```
let a = true;
let b: bool = true;

let (x, y) = (1, 2);

let mut z = 5;
z = 6;
```

* Constants

```
const N: i32 = 5;
```

* Statics

```
static N: i32 = 5;
```

**let** keyword is used in binding expressions. We can bind a name to a value or a function. Also because of left-hand side of a let expression is a â€˜patternâ€™, you can bind multiple names to set of values or function values.

**const** keyword is used to define constants. It lives for the entire lifetime of a program but have no fixed address in memory. **static** keyword is used to define â€˜global variableâ€™ type facility. There is only one instance for each value, and itâ€™s at a **fixed location in memory**.

ðŸ’¡ **Always use const**, instead of static. Itâ€™s pretty rare that you actually want a memory location associated with your constant, and using a const allows for optimizations like constant propagation not only in your crate but also in downstream crates.

ðŸ’¡ Usually statics are placed at top of the code file, outside the functions.
