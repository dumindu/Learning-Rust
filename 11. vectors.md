# Vectors

If you remember, array is a  fixed-size list of elements, of same data type. even with mut, itâ€™s element count can not be changed. Vector is kind of a re-sizable array but all elements must be in the same type.

ðŸŒŸ Itâ€™s a generic type, written as Vec<T>Â . T can have any type, ex. The type of a Vec of i32s is Vec<i32>. Also Vectors always allocate their data in dynamically allocated heap.
