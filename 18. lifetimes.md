# Lifetimes

When we are dealing with references, we have to make sure that the referencing data stay alive until we are stop using the references.

Think,
* We have a variable binding, “**a**”.
* We are referencing the value of “a”, from another variable binding “**x**”.
We have to make sure that “a” **lives** until we stop using “x”

> 🔎 **Memory management** is a form of resource management applied to computer memory. Up until the mid-1990s, the majority of programming languages used **Manual Memory Management** which **requires the programmer to give manual instructions** to identify and deallocate unused objects/ garbage. Around 1959 John McCarthy invented **Garbage collection**(GC), a form of **Automatic Memory Management**(AMM). It determines what memory is no longer used and frees it automatically instead of relying on the programmer. However **Objective-C and Swift** provide similar functionality through **Automatic Reference Counting**(ARC).


In Rust, 

* A resource can only have **one owner** at a time. When it goes **out of the scope**, Rust removes it from the Memory.
* When we want to reuse the same resource, we are **referencing** it/ **borrowing** its content. 
* When dealing with **references**, we have to specify **lifetime annotations** to provide instructions for the **compiler** to set **how long** those referenced resources **should be alive**.
* ⭐️But because of lifetime annotations make **code more verbose**, in order to make **common patterns** more ergonomic, Rust allows lifetimes to be **elided/omitted** in `fn` definitions. In this case, the compiler assigns lifetime annotations **implicitly**.

Lifetime annotations are **checked at compile-time**. Compiler checks when a data is used for the first and the last times. According to that, Rust manages memory in **run time**. This is the major reason of having **slower compilation times** in Rust.

> 
* Unlike C and C++, **usually** Rust doesn’t explicitly drop values at all. 
* Unlike GC, Rust doesn’t place deallocation calls where the data is no longer referenced.
* Rust places deallocation calls where the data is about to go out of the scope and then enforces that no references to that resource exist after that point.

💡 Lifetimes are denoted with an apostrophe. By convention, a lowercase letter is used for naming. Usually **starts with** `'a` and **follows alphabetic order** when we need to add **multiple lifetime** annotations.

When using references,

01. On **Function Declaration**

* Input and output parameters with references should attach lifetimes after `&` sign. ex `..(x: &'a str)` , `..(x: &'a mut str)` 
* After the function name, we should mention that the given lifetimes are generic types. ex `fn foo<'a>(..)` , `fn foo<'a, 'b>(..)`
 
```rust
// no inputs, return a reference
fn function<'a>() -> &'a str {} 

// single input
fn function<'a>(x: &'a str) {}

// single input and output, both has same lifetime
// output should live at least as long as input exists
fn function<'a>(x: &'a str) -> &'a str {}

// multiple inputs, only one input and the output share same lifetime
// output should live at least as long as y exists
fn function<'a>(x: i32, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {}

// multiple inputs. both inputs and the output share same lifetime
// output should live at least as long as x and y exist
fn function<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {}

// multiple inputs. inputs can have diffent lifetimes 🔎
// output should live at least as long as x exists
fn function<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &'a str {}
```

02. On **Struct or Enum Declaration**

* Elements with references should attach lifetimes after `&` sign.
* After the name of the struct or enum, we should mention that the given lifetimes are generic types.

```rust
// single element
// data of x should live at least as long as Struct exists
struct Struct<'a> { 
    x: &'a str 
}

// multiple elements
// data of x and y should live at least as long as Struct exists
struct Struct<'a> { 
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str 
}


// variant with single element
// data of the variant should live at least as long as Enum exists
enum Enum<'a> { 
    Variant(&'a Type)
}
```

03. With **Impls and Traits**

```rust
struct Struct<'a> { 
    x: &'a str 
}
    impl<'a> Struct<'a> { 
        fn function<'a>(&self) -> &'a str {
            self.x 
        }
    }


struct Struct<'a> { 
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str
}
    impl<'a> Struct<'a> { 
        fn new(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> Struct<'a> { //no need to specify <'a> after new; impl already has it
          Struct {
              x : x,
              y : y
          }
        }
    }


// 🔎
impl<'a> Trait<'a> for Type
impl<'a> Trait for Type<'a>
```

04. With **Generic Types**

```rust
// 🔎
fn function<F>(f: F) where for<'a> F: FnOnce(&'a Type)
struct Struct<F> where for<'a> F: FnOnce(&'a Type) { x: F }
enum Enum<F> where for<'a> F: FnOnce(&'a Type) { Variant(F) }
impl<F> Struct<F> where for<'a> F: FnOnce(&'a Type) { fn x(&self) -> &F { &self.x } }
```
