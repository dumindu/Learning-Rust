# Cargo, Crates and Basic Project Structure

Cargo is Rust’s build-in Package Manager. But mainly it uses for,  

▸ Create new project : `cargo new`  
▸ Update dependencies : `cargo update`  
▸ Build project : `cargo build`  
▸ Build and run a project : `cargo run`  
▸ Run tests : `cargo test`  
▸ Generate documentation via rustdoc : `cargo doc`  

Other than that there are some cargo commands, especially for publishing crates directly via cargo.

▸ `cargo login` : acquiring an API token  
▸ `cargo package` : make the local create uploadable to crates.io  
▸ `cargo publish` : make the local create uploadable to crates.io and upload the crate  

⭐️ **A crate is a package. Crates can be shared via [Cargo](https://crates.io/).**

A crate can produce an executable or a library. In other words, it can be a binary crate or a library crate.  
01.  `cargo new crate_name --bin` : produces an executable  
02.  `cargo new crate_name --lib` OR `cargo new crate_name`: produces a library  

The first one generates,
```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

and the second one generates,

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

* **Cargo.toml**(capital c) is the configuration file which contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile your project. 
* **src** folder is the place to store the source code. 
* Each crate has an implicit crate root/ entry point. **main.rs** is the crate root for a binary crate and **lib.rs** is the crate root for a library crate. 

💡 When we build a binary crate via `cargo build` or `cargo run`, the executable file will be stored in **target/debug/** folder. But when build it via `cargo build --release` for a release it will be stored in **target/release/** folder.

This is how [Cargo Docs describes](http://doc.crates.io/guide.html#project-layout) about the recommended Project Layout,

```
.
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── benches
│   └── large-input.rs
├── examples
│   └── simple.rs
├── src
│   ├── bin
│   │   └── another_executable.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── main.rs
└── tests
    └── some-integration-tests.rs
```

▸ Source code goes in the `src` directory.
▸ The default library file is `src/lib.rs`.
▸ The default executable file is `src/main.rs`.
▸ Other executables can be placed in `src/bin/*.rs`.
▸ Integration tests go in the `tests` directory (unit tests go in each file they're testing).
▸ Examples go in the `examples` directory.
▸ Benchmarks go in the `benches` directory.
